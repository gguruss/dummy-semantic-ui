[LIVE DEMO](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/supzeroIs/dummy-semantic-ui/blob/master/dist/index.html)

Just like ['Denali'](http://demoblvd.com/themes/denali/demo-1/) this theme is based on; 

Dummy Semantic-UI template bare-bones semantic-ui theme created to act as a starting point for the theme designer.
Free of all presentational elements and non-semantic markup,

Dummy Semantic-UI template is the perfect 'blank slate' 
for your semantic-ui projects, 

as it's a clean version of the 'Default' theme with some style.

Best of all: it's free and fully GPL-licensed, so you can use it for whatever you like - even your commercial projects.
